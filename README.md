# silhouette
In this code, I implement the silhouette score for clustering techniques in R

In this exercise, several functions have been implemented to
calculate the silhouette coefficient, which are divided in the
next steos: 1.- Function to get the indexes of the vector points
in a certain cluster, 2.- Function to get the distance between
two points, 3.- Function to calculate the intracluster distance
”a”, 4.- Function to calculate the distance between a point and
all points in the cluster, 5.- Function to calculate the intercluster
distance ”b”, 6.- Function to calculate the silhouette values,
7.- Function to calculate the silhouette score.
Due to the complexity of implementation, the final results are
summarized in the calculation of the silhouette score, however,
additional modifications must be performed to obtain the plots
regarding the cluster selection and silhouette score.

Results can be appreciated below:
